1. This file is hw9.txt

2. git checkout -b quote v3.0 - creates a new branch quote off of v3.0

3. We apply our patch, which removes grave accents only from output statements and not
   documentation by running the following:

   patch -p1 <quote-3.0-patch.txt

5. I then emacs into each of the 6 chanegd files and C-x 4 a to add a changelog for them.

6. I then commit these files to my 'quote' branch using:

   git add .
   git commit -F ChangeLog

7. Generate a formatted patchfile using:

   git format-patch --stdout -1 > formatted-patch.txt

8. Verfied that my partner's patch file works on a new temporary branch of v3.0.

   git am < newPatch.txt

   Rebuilding to run make check:

   ./bootstrap, ./configure, make, make check

9. Ran make distdir
   Then, on inspecting the diffutils*/ChangeLog file with the following command:

   nano diffutils-3.0.1-3b1be/ChangeLog

   I can see that the first message on the log is mine. Hence, verified that ChangeLog
   worked.

10. ssh -X hirday@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu (With X forwarding for GUI)

    export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH (to get gitk command)

    cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs

    run `gitk` as instructed

    Window pops up on XQuartz

    Scrollling through the list on the top-right window helps me find a merge dated
    2015-01-24 19:00:41 - a commit by Professor Eggert.

    I then screenshot this view and describe it.


Thank you!
