Q1. Brady's patched removed the line merely to clean up the code.
    The line served as a go-to marker, and in his patch, he removed the only
    line that referred to it. Hence, he removed that line too. The patch would
    still work if he hadn't removed it, so it wasn't absolutely necessary,
    but if he had left it in, then other programmers would have to remember
    that they cannot reuse that phrase "case_long_iso_time_style:" as a go-to
    marker elsewhere. Hence, it was essential he remove it to clean up the code. 

Q2. Since this version of ls displays the date only in english, it may cause a
    problem in non-english speaking countries. And if the locale settings set
    the language to other than english, then intersting problems such as incor
    -rect date displaying may arise.

Q3. An IndexError is raised. This is because python's random.choice function 
    expects a non-empty collection, and when it is given an empty one, the
    docs say it will raise the IndexError. Since /dev/null is an empty file,
    the function is given an empty collection and hence the error is raised.
    Lastly, the reason the function random.choice is called on an empty file
    in the first place, is because the default value for numlines is 1.

Q4. When the script is run on python3, a compile time error is thrown. This is
    because python3 no longer supports "automatic tuple unpacking." Hence,
    line 65 needs to be re-written as "except IOError as err" and then err can
    be checked for errno or strerror.
