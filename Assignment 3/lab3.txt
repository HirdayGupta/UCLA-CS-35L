1. First, I used wget to get `Coreutils 7.6` from
   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
2. Next, I used `tar -xzvf` to uncompress the coreutils into a custom folder.
   2.1  After reading the INSTALL file in coreutils, I ran the ./configure 
   	command with the --prefix flag "/u/cs/ugrad/hirday/coreutilsInstall"
	(to install in a custom directory). Followed this by `make` and
	`make install` to compile and install.
3. (Did not need to use locale-gen as mentioned in the spec) Managed to
   reproduce the bug by cd-ing into "~/coreutilsInstall" (where I installed the
   coreutils package) and running "./bin/ls -l"
4. Used emacs to create the patch file (from
   https://www.mail-archive.com/bug-coreutils@gnu.org/msg17927.html)
   and then ran the command "patch -p1 <patchFile". (p1 helped me get rid of the
   "a/" and "b/" from the patch file).
5. Used make to compile the newly patched file. Make seemed to run a command
   called "make-all-recursive" which essentially traverses recursively through
   each of the sub-directories and compiles any changed files. Between all the
   "entering directory" and "leaving directory" log outputs, it was evident that
   it used the CC variable to compile ls.o in the src directory (which was one
   of the changed files, and hence, necessary.) It also seems to update the man
   pages for ls.1. It also seems to make some changes to files by the name of
   "dir" and "vdir" - which I'm not sure are necessary.
   Here is the output from make to cross-verify my observations from above.

6. Tested by using the touch command (touch -m [file], touch -m -d [file])
   [before patch] -rw-r--r-- 1 hirday csugrad    0 2018-02-03 20:09 newFile

   Running just make (and not make install) allowed me to run the modified
   version from the source directory and the installed version from the
   installed directory and compare outputs.
