1. man -k

2. cp:  /usr/local/cs/coreutils-8.29/bin/cp
   wc:  /usr/local/cs/coreutils-8.29/bin/wc
   
   Shell Commands Used:
   which cp (led me to /usr/local/cs/bin/cp)
   ls -l cp (led me to the /usr/local/cs/coreutils-8.29/bin/cp)
   (same with wc)

3. ./X , ./w & ./[

   Shell Commands Used:
   cd /usr/bin (Since this is where the source files for executables are)
   find -executable -name "?"

4. /usr/bin/emacs-24.3 is actually executed.

   Shell Commands Used:
   ls -l /usr/bin/emacs
   ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs
   ls -l /usr/bin/emacs-24.3

5. g+s: When any user in the current user's group executes the file being modified
   	the file's ownership Group ID changes to that of the user's group ID.
        This essentially allows users in the current user's group to execute the
	file with owner permission.
   o-x: This symbolic mode changes the file's permissions such that users which 
        are not in the file's group can not execute the file.

   Shell Commands Used:
   man chmod

6. find -mtime -21 (Used -21 because question asked for "in the last three weeks"
   as opposed to "exactly three weeks ago"). 

7. Following are the files (in my default directory) that were edited in the last
   three weeks.
  ./Desktop
  ./Desktop/$RECYCLE.BIN
  ./Documents
  ./Documents/$RECYCLE.BIN
  ./Downloads
  ./Downloads/$RECYCLE.BIN
  ./.cache/abrt
  ./.emacs.d
  ./.emacs.d/auto-save-list
  ./CS35L
   
   Shell Commands Used:
   find -type d -mtime -21

8. 270

  Shell Commands Used:
  cd /usr/bin
  find -type l > ~/foo.txt
  cat ~/foo.txt -n (got answer from line numbers)

9. libgpg-error.so.0.10.0 is the oldest regular file.

   Shell Commands Used:
   cd /usr/lib
   ls -l -t -a -r (-l long lists, -t sorts by modtime, -r lists in reverse
   (so oldest first) and -a includes all files (even those starting with '.')
   (Confirmed that the answer was a regular file by the '-' in the 'file type'
   region of the descriptive string in ls long listing format)

10. From the locale man pages, it is clear that locale gets its data from some
    environment variables. Visiting 'man 7 locale' (locale(7)) seems to suggest
    that LOCPATH is the environment variable that stores the paths to compiled
    local data files. '/usr/lib/locale' is the default path for individual
    compiled locale files.

11. Buffer-menu-sort, sort-columns, sort-fields, sort-lines, sort-numeric-fields,
    sort-pages, sort-paragraphs, sort-regexp-fields, 
    tabulated-list-col-sort, tabulated-list-sort
    Emacs Command Used: C-h a sort

12. C-M-a           beginning-of-defun: move backward to the beginning of defun
    C-M-b           backward-sexp: move backward across one balanced expression
    C-M-c           exit-recursive-edit: exit from the innermost recursive edit
    C-M-d           down-list: move forward down one level of parenthesis
    C-M-e           end-of-defun: move forward to next end of defun
    C-M-f           forward-sexp: mpve forward across one balanced expression
    C-M-g	    (No such command)
    C-M-h           mark-defun: put mark at end of this defun and point at
    		    beginning

    Emacs Commands Used:
    C-h b (searched all key bindings for C-M-a through C-M-h and noted function
    names)
    C-h a FUNCTION_NAME (searched all the function names I found from above for 
    brief description of what they do)

13. C-g is the keyboard-quit command. It quits any partially typed command,
    one that is currently running or removes an unwanted numerical argument.
    C-g works by setting the 'quit-flag' variable to 't' the instant C-g is
    typed. Emacs lisp checks this variable frequently, and quits if it is
    'non-nil'. 
    Emacs Command Used:
    C-h F keyboard-quit

14. “Yanking” means reinserting text previously killed.  The usual way to
    move or copy text is to kill it and then yank it elsewhere. `C-y`, the
    yank command, Yanks the last kill into the buffer, at the current cursor
    position.

15. The only difference between the outpur of the ls -l command and the emacs
    dired command is that the emacs dired command's first line says
    "total used in directory 328740 available 13034240" and the ls -l command's
    first line says "total 328660". Hence, the dired command also prints the
    available space whereas the dired command does not.
    Emacs Commands Used: C-x d /usr/bin
    Shell commands used: ls -l /usr/bin
