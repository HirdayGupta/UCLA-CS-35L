Name: Hirday Gupta. UID: 505-008-404

My lab partner was Daksh Idnani (204-911-462).

Followed the setup instruction on Piazza
(https://piazza.com/class/jc5z73cpj8rtt?cid=388)

ran both of the following commands (without checking if they were installed
to install potential updates)
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Followed the server-side steps as mentioned in the slides.

Created a user for Daksh on my BeagleBone:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/daksh -m daksh
$ sudo passwd daksh
(set password to 'daksh', solely for ironic purposes)

Allowed Daksh to SSH into my BeagleBone:
$ cd /home/daksh
$ sudo mkdir .ssh
$ sudo chowown -R daksh .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Daksh performed equivalent steps on his end to setup his server, creating a
user 'hirday' on his device.

Followed the client-side steps as outlined in the slides.

Created public and private keys
$ ssh-keygen (created in ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

Copied my public key onto my user on daksh's machine.
$ ssh-copy-id -i hirday@172.20.10.2
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" (enable ssh-agent)
$ ssh-add (add private key to ssh-agent)
$ ssh hirday@172.20.10.2

Managed to successfully ssh without a password. Victory!
